Q1: 
The order of the rotations is changed using keypress '1' and '2'. This will
change the order between XYZ and YXZ with XYZ as the default. 
The chosen order is used in the function DrawRotatedTeapot.

Q2: 
The gimbal lock problem is that the order of rotation operations can have a 
big impact on the resulting total rotation. 
In our example we observe that instead of rotating around the X, Y and Z axis, 
the third teapot rotates only around the x axis.
This is because with the order of XYZ the teapot first rotates around the X axis 
as expected, then rotates around the Y axis but because the Y rotation was 
90 degrees the Z axis is now the old X axis. This means that when we rotate around
the Z axis is looks like we are rotating around the X axis again. 

When the order is changed to YXZ this problem doesn't exist with this perticular 
combination of rotations.
