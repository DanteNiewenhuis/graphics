Q1: XYZ

Q2: The rotation-order is XYZ, so we start with X. Lets say we do not rotate around the X-axis (it does not matter in this example, 
so an angle of zero degrees suffices). Then we rotate around Y. We know this is 90 degrees (as this is what we specified when
initializing the object). This rotation causes Z to coincide with the X-axis. Therefore, now rotating around our Z-axis will result
in rotating around our X axis again. 
Hence, because of this 90 degree rotation in Y, we caused the first circle-of-rotation from X to align with the 
circle-of-rotation from Z.
