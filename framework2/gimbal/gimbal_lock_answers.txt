Q1: XYZ

Q2: Rotating around Y first (how the model is initialized in the world) causes Z and to align
with the original X position and X becomes -Z. 
Say, we follow the the ordering of Q1: X, then Y, then Z. If we rotate around X we do not have 
a problem yet. However, if we rotate around Y, then Z is moved to the original position of X 
(and hence X and Z coincide). Finally, rotating around Z results in identical movement to X.
